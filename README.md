# dotfiles
My dotfiles

Heavily inspired by [webpro/dotfiles](https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles) and [anishathalye/dotfiles](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotfiles)

Makes symlinks for `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`, `git/.gitconfig`, `git/.gitignore_global`, `git/.git-prompt.sh` at `~`.

Extra stuff can be added locally at `$HOME/.extra` (per-machine), which will be loaded by `.bashrc`

`.bash_profile` calls `.bashrc`, which loads things

TODO : installation
